# Coursera_Capstone
This repository contains my responses to the Coursera Capstone project on Segmenting and Clustering Neighborhoods in Toronto. 
Each part of the response is contained in a separate Jupyter notebook. The repository also holds csv files containing data
that is used in separate parts of the project.
